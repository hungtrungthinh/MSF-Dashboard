Installation and Usage
----------------------

MSF Dashboard can be deployed in a variety of contexts. It is a micro-website which, in its 'essential' version, does not require more than a web browser (Firefox or equivalent or Chrome or equivalent, IE is support is not guaranteed at the moment). It is run offline thanks to nwjs which includes a node instance and allow usage of more advanced file manipulation.

The main constraints for installation are:
- Online or offline implementation.
- Connexion with data source. 

The setup that are currently supported and have been tested include:
- Offline implementation with nwjs micro-server (data parsed via excel-spreadsheets, csv, tsv, dedicated datamanager).
- Online implementation without backend (data parsed via json file directly uploaded to the website).
- Online implementation with backend (data parsed via various APIs...).

The technical side of a MSF-Dashboard deployment is generally a 3-steps process:
- 1) Parsing and formatting data 
- 2) Configuring the MSF-Dashboard
- 3) Hosting the MSF-Dashboard

+ [Surveillance-Tonkolili](http://braimbault.github.io/MSF-Dashboard_Surveillance-Tonkolili/demo-site/) - April 2016 (offline, data parsed via dedicated datamanager)
+ [Surveillance-ERU](http://braimbault.github.io/NA) - June 2016 (offline, data parsed via excel-spreadsheets)
